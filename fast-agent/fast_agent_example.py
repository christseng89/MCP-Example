Fast-Agent Python Example
=========================

This example demonstrates how to use the fast-agent framework to create
AI agents that can integrate with MCP (Model Context Protocol) services.

Requirements:
- fast-agent library
- Python 3.8+
- UV package manager (recommended)

Usage:
    uv run fast_agent_example.py
    # or
    python fast_agent_example.py
