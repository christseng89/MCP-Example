## 06.2 Multi-agent PDF to Ghost Blog

### Use cases

*🎓 Academic Papers -> 📄 Engaging Blog Posts

### Setup Ghost

ID: samfire5200
Password: t0nnn#Xxxxx

### Create a custom integration (where the keys are issued)

1. Log into your Ghost Admin panel as an **Owner** (owner-level access is required):
   `https://your-ghost-site.com/ghost/`
2. In the left menu, go to **Settings → Integrations**.
3. Click **“Add custom integration”** (or **“Add integration”** → **Custom integration**).
4. Give the integration a name (e.g., `My Admin Tool`) and save.
5. After creation you will see two keys shown for that integration:

   * **Content API Key** — read-only, for public content (use for front-end/read operations).
   * **Admin API Key** — admin-level key string (format: `id:secret`) used to call the Admin API.
6. **Copy the Admin API Key** (the UI shows it once). Store it securely (secrets store / environment variable).

> Note: If you don’t see the Integrations menu or cannot create custom integrations, verify you’re logged in as the site **Owner** and that your Ghost installation version supports integrations (almost all recent versions do). For Ghost(Pro) customers the process is the same via Admin UI.
