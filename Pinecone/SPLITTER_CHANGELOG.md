# Text Splitter Update Changelog

## ✅ Implemented Recursive Character Text Splitter

### 🎯 Configuration Match
Updated `embed_folder.py` to match the Recursive Character Text Splitter interface settings:

| Parameter | Value | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| **Chunk Size** | `1000` | ✅ Optimal chunk size in characters |
| **Chunk Overlap** | `120` | ✅ Context continuity between chunks |
| **Type** | `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` | ✅ Advanced LangChain text splitting |

### 🚀 Technical Implementation

1. **Added LangChain Integration**:
   ```python
   from langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
   ```

2. **Configured Text Splitter**:
   ```python
   # Recursive Character Text Splitter Configuration
   CHUNK_SIZE = 1000        # Chunk size in characters  
   CHUNK_OVERLAP = 120      # Chunk overlap in characters

   text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
       chunk_size=chunk_size,
       chunk_overlap=chunk_overlap,
       length_function=len,  # Use character count
       separators=[
           "\n\n",    # Double newline (paragraphs)
           "\n",      # Single newline (lines) 
           " ",       # Space (words)
           ".",       # Period
           ",",       # Comma
           # Additional separators for international text
           "\u200b",  # Zero-width space
           "\uff0c",  # Full-width comma
           "\u3001",  # Ideographic comma
           "\uff0e",  # Full-width period
           "\u3002",  # Ideographic period
           "",        # Last resort - split by character
       ],
       keep_separator=True,
   )
   ```

### 🔧 Enhanced Features

1. **Smart Separators**: Hierarchical splitting by paragraphs → lines → words → punctuation
2. **International Support**: Handles full-width characters and ideographic punctuation
3. **Fallback System**: Simple text splitting if RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter fails
4. **Context Preservation**: 120-character overlap maintains context between chunks
5. **Character-Based**: Uses character count instead of tokens for consistent chunking

### 📊 Processing Benefits

- **Better Context**: Maintains semantic boundaries with paragraph/sentence awareness
- **Consistent Size**: Character-based chunking ensures predictable chunk sizes
- **Overlap Optimization**: 120-character overlap balances context vs. efficiency
- **Error Resilience**: Fallback method ensures processing continues if LangChain fails

### 🎉 Results

```bash
✅ Text Splitter Config: chunk_size=1000, overlap=120
✅ Split test text into 5 chunks
✅ RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter imported successfully
✅ Text splitter configured with chunk_size=1000, overlap=120
```

### 📋 Updated Configuration Display

The script now shows:
```
📝 Text Splitter configuration:
   Type: Recursive Character Text Splitter
   Chunk Size: 1000 characters
   Chunk Overlap: 120 characters
```

### 📚 Documentation Updates

- **`example.env`**: Added TEXT_CHUNK_SIZE and TEXT_CHUNK_OVERLAP options
- **`README.md`**: Updated features to highlight advanced text splitting
- **`pyproject.toml`**: Added `langchain-text-splitters>=0.0.1` dependency

### 🎯 Perfect Match

The implementation now exactly matches the Recursive Character Text Splitter interface shown in your image, providing optimal document chunking for RAG applications!
